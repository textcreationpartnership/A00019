            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE GRACE AND FAVOVR of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God, and communication of his holy ſpirite, reſt in you (dearelye beloued) to the confirmacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your life in godlynes, vnto the ende. Amen.</head>
            <p>IT was not without an vrge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe (louyng frendes) that our ſauiour Chriſt preachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his excellent Sermonin the mount to his diſciples,<note place="margin">Math. vii Luk. vi, and .xiiii.</note> did knitte vp the ſame wyth the ſymilitude of a wiſe &amp; foliſh builder. The one buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the rocke, the other vpon the ſand: The one buylding remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the other vtterlye decaied, by the impetuous rage of raine, wynde and floudes. wherin it behoueth vs, to conſider principally .iii. thinges. Firſt, that the beginning of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion, conſiſteth in diligent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and not in idle liuing. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the cauſe why we muſt builde, is to the entent, that in tyme of nede, we may haue a ſtrong caſtel, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible fortreſſe, to flie vnto, in all our neceſſities, therby the better to be preſerued from the power, tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſodaine inuaſion of all our
<pb facs="tcp:12903:3"/>
enemies. Thirdly, in this ſimilitude, we are admoniſhed, that as vereli as we haue built our tower, &amp; that as verely as it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth: ſo certeinly ſhal therain deſcend, the wyndes blow, &amp; the flouds ariſe againſt it, to trye the ſtrength and ſituacion thereof.</p>
            <p>VVe the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flock of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) bi the merciful prouidence of God, for the ſpace of .vi. or .vii. yeres haue enioied a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful calm &amp; quiet time to build out tower (god his name be praiſed therfore) much like the Halcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dares, when the Hal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion birdes do hatche &amp; bring forth their yong ones, voide of al ſtormy te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſtes. For ſo hath God ben accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to deale with his Churche, namely to nouriſh the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, during their infancie, in a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful calme and quietnes, till they be growen vp into perfect men: able to receiue ſtrong meates, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth he alter their diet, from ſwetenes to towernes, from pleaſure to paine. &amp; from quietnes to aduerſitie. Suche was the ſecuritie &amp; quietnes of the church of God,<note place="margin">Gene. vi.</note> while the Arke was in building, in the daies of Noe: but
<pb facs="tcp:12903:3"/>
immediatelye after, there folowed ſuch a tempeſt, as ouerwhelmed the whole race of the earth.<note place="margin">ii. Para. v</note> Suche was alſo the quietnes amongſt the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, while the temple was in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, in the dayes of Salomon: but immediatelye after, there folowed ſuche a diuiſion, as ſubuerted the whole la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Such alſo was the calme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and quietnes of the church, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the preſence of Chriſte, in the fleſhe: in ſo much that his diſciples wanted no maner of thing,<note place="margin">Math. ix.</note> neyther could thei mone or wepe, while the bridgrom was with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but after he was aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, their ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti war turned into ſcarciti, &amp; their mirth into mut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning. Suche hath bene the calmenes of other realmes, wheras the goſpel fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time hath ben preached, as Germani. &amp; other places, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly of this realme of Englande, that a greater hath not bene heard of, nor knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherin no enemi durſt apear without rebuke, to hinder our forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſame. Wherfore let vs not now meruel, nor yet be abaſhed if our heauenlye father deale wyth vs his chyldren, as he hathe dealte
<pb facs="tcp:12903:4"/>
with our predeceſſoures, from the beginning: That is, after a calme, to ſtirre vp a tempeſt, after quietneſſe, trouble: and after ſecuritie, &amp; eaſe, trauaile and paine, to trye our buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal,<note place="margin">Math. vii</note> whether it be ſituated vpon the rocke Chriſt, in the puritie of his goſpel, through perfect faith and godly life, to remain euermore: or els vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſand of the vanitie of this world, in the decres, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and pleaſures of men, through hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, forth with to be ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. Fot as S. Paule ſaieth: a tyme wyl come,<note place="margin">i. Cor. iii.</note> wherin the fire of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſhal try eueri mans building, whether he haue buylded gold, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or precious ſtone: eyther ſtraw, haye, or timber. And me thinke bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I ſe the ſame time appeare, as it were Helias his cloude, riſing out of the ſea,<note place="margin">iii. Regu. xviii,</note> being as yet no bigger tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an hand: but forthwith I feare me, it wil ſpread ouer al this land. wher fore with the prophet, let vs gird vp our loines, and runne in tyme to our tower, before the ſtorme deſcende: and therin, if the ſame be buylded vpon the rocke Chriſt, we ſhall not
<pb facs="tcp:12903:4"/>
only find conſolation, but alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. And for this purpoſe,<note place="margin">ii. Tim. ii.</note> we ar called in the ſcriptures wariours, and ſouldiours. wherfore now that the battaile approcheth, wherwith the enemies purpoſeth to beſeage our fortreſſe: let vs not as Cowards waxe faint harted, running awai be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the blowes, but rather as men, tepleate with an inuincible courage and boldnes, let vs ſtand to our tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in holding faſt the ploughe of our profeſſion, whereunto we haue put to handes: &amp; thus not in confy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our own ſtrength, which is nothing, but in the force &amp; ſtrength of our captaine, vnder whoſe ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we haue promiſed to fight, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che was neuer ouercome, beaten downe, not put to flight: but by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering hath ſubdued al his enemies, and by a croſſe, vanquiſhed his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. And as he our head, hath gone before, the ſtraight pathe, and narrow way vnto eternall lyfe: euen ſo muſt we his members folowe the ſame race, if we wil in herit his king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome. And for this purpoſe, ſaieth S. Paule,<note place="margin">Rom. viii</note> are we facioned vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:12903:5"/>
ſhape of the ſonne of God, not only to raigne with him in glory, but alſo to ſuffer with him in miſerie. For as he ſaith in another place: Yf we die with him,<note place="margin">li. Tim. ii.</note> we ſhal alſo liue with him if we be patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we ſhal alſo raigne with him. But if we ſhal deni hi, he ſhal alſo deni vs. For the affliccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this life, ar not compatable to the glori of the life to come. This is the only wai brethren, that the church of god obtaineth victorie bi, not as worldli princes do bi ſubduing, but bi ſuffering: not bi drawing out the ſwerd with Peter, but bi hauing our heads ſtriken of with the ſame: not bi impriſoning, &amp; binding of other, but bi being impriſoned &amp; bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one ſelues. For as Chriſtes kingdom was not of this world, as he himſelf wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, no more is out force, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; inheritance here. For our porcion in this life, is but as ſhepe apointed to the ſlaughter, &amp; as pilgrims, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling through mani tribulacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities &amp; miſeris,<note place="margin">Pſa. xliiii i. Pete. ii.</note> towards the land of promiſe, being compaſſed about with enemies on eueri ſide. But thei with al their malice, ſhal not anoye vs, nor yet hinder our iourney, if we
<pb facs="tcp:12903:5"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue faithfull, but rather further the ſame. Yea, the lord wil neuer for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſake vs, but bi day go before vs, in a cloude. &amp; by night in a piller of fire. And although Moſes for our vnwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thines be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs:<note place="margin">Exo. xiiii</note> yet will the Lord ſtir vp a Ioſuah, to lead vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our inhentaunce, in throwing out our enemyes before our faces. Here is ſet furth (brethren) the tragedi of our liues. Let vs be contented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, &amp; aboue al thinges, let vs auoy de murmutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt the higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, who are Gods inſtruments, to worke his will: whether it be life, or death, good or euil, leaſt we periſhe with the rebellious Iſraelites in the deſert. Furthermore,<note place="margin">Nu. xiiii. and .xvi.</note> if we do depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the great vtilitie that the croſſe bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to the church of god, we haue rather occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wiſh for it, &amp; to reioyce whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repine &amp; murmur. For bi it our fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is tried, our faith confirmed, our knowledge encreaſed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in praier exerciſed, being fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; hipocrites ſeparated, wherby the droſſe &amp; corruption of our life is beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, as the ruſt of iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<pb facs="tcp:12903:6"/>
For if we lye ſtill as ruſtye yronne, &amp; be not brought vnder the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer of aduerſiti, we conſume away, and ſerue to no vſe. For gold is not puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but by fyre. wherfore if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be pure, let vs not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſpiſe that fyre, wherby we at made pure. For hitherto we haue experienced a chriſtian life, as Children practiſe the feates of warre, by ſygnes and ſhewes without any bloudy battail, in triumphing before the victori: but victorye is not optained wyth loſſe and daunger. Chriſt our heade, loſt his humayne lyfe, to optaine victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for vs, and to triumph ouer oure ennemies: and do we thincke to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame, by ſytting in ſecuriti and eaſe at home in our houſes? paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing our tyme in pleaſures, eaſe and ioye, with our wyues, children and frendes, enuironed with our ryches, lands, and poſſeſſions, without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Now brethren, if ther be a battail towards, as we ſuppoſe, let vs ſhew our ſelues worthy ſouldiours, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the worthines of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, whom we ſerue, who did not let to abando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his incomparable glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye, and to clothe him ſelf with our miſerable humanitie, for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: therin optaining victory, not for him, but for vs. So likewiſe, let ther be no worldli thing ſo dear vnto vs, as may once retorte, or ſtrai vs, from faithful ſeruing of our lord and prince, whoſe ſeruauntes we ar by profeſſion (and I truſt by elecci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) without any mutacion,<note place="margin">Rom. viii</note> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in probation, the ende whereof is glorificacion.

Settle thine hart, &amp; be pacient, &amp; ſhrincke not awaye, when thou art entiſed. Read for your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation the hole chapter, for therin is briefly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, what ought to be the life of a Chriſtian, &amp; wherunto he muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe, euen to the croſſe of tribulation, as to the only ſouerigne medicine to cure al our feſtered diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.

For the wicked &amp; the vngodly, are nothing els, but the inſtruments of god, wher by he worketh his pleaſure: As wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth the prophet Eſaias,<note place="margin">Eſaye. x.</note> calling them Axes, Sawes, Rods, &amp; Staues which can procede no further, then it pleaſeth their owner to vſe them to his glory.
